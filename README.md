## Hi!
I'm currently learning iOS development with Swift. I have decided to put all my tiny projects that I develop as part of my learning process on GitHub! 

## Projects

#### Project 01 - [Table View](https://github.com/itsnauman/RoadToSwift/tree/master/Project%2001%20-%20Table%20View)

I learned how to:
* Implement a Table View
* Use delete cell action to delete a cell
